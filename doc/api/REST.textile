h1. REST API

List the domains available:

bc. curl -v http://localhost:8080/baseurl/

p. Without specifying an @Accept@ header, the response would look like:

bc.. HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: ...
Server: Spring Data Services Web Exporter/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT

http://localhost:8080/baseurl/service1/
http://localhost:8080/baseurl/service2/
http://localhost:8080/baseurl/service3/

p. Specifying an Accept header will cause this output to be render to the representation specified. e.g. for JSON:

bc.. [
  {"link": {"rel": "service", url: "http://localhost:8080/baseurl/service1/"}},
  {"link": {"rel": "service", url: "http://localhost:8080/baseurl/service2/"}},
  {"link": {"rel": "service", url: "http://localhost:8080/baseurl/service3/"}}
]
